I am interested in the areas of Machine Learning and Computer Security. You can contact me via email at [nadavo@umich.edu](mailto:nadavo@umich.edu).

I am currently an undegraduate researcher at the [Censored Planet](https://censoredplanet.org/) lab where I help research the detection and mesuarement of internet censorship worldwide. I will be interning this summer (2023) as a software engineering intern at [Capital One](https://www.capitalone.com/) and previously did similar internships at [Allegis Group](https://www.allegisgroup.com/) and [LTN Global Communications](https://ltnglobal.com/).

I have experience working with various types of Machine Learning methods in Python and also programming with C/C++ on Linux systems. I am also familiar with several SQL and NoSQL database systems. 

On campus, I am invloved with several student organizations, such as the [Michigan Data Sciecne Team] (https://www.mdst.club/), where I am a project lead, [IEEE-HKN](https://hkn.eecs.umich.edu) (the honor society for Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UofM) as well as being active in the [University of Michigan Hillel](https://michiganhillel.org) community.
